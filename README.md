*A quick explanation of how to properly run this server*

To run this server, you can do one of two things:

1. Run "npm start" in your terminal, and then type "localhost:3000" in your browser
2. Visit the Render link provided in my assignment submission

Upon running the server, you will see that the browser returns a message that says "Not found". This is because the URL does not explicitly call for the name route by default. In order to call the name route, you must add "/name" to the end of the URL, and then enter the site. Your browser should now successfully call and display the correct name.
